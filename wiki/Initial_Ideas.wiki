= List of things to do =

1. Mex file to check if OpenCL platform available:
- devicelist = get_cldevices( )
- Returns an array of strings containing the available platforms and devices for each platform. Index of list specifies the GPGPU device to utilize.

2. Need a mex file that does initialisation, data loading, kernel execution, etc..
- result = execute_gpu(cmd_string, ...)
- Thoughts: Need to utilize mexAtExit to register a function to de-initialize (properly close) device. Use global static variable for context and have kernels containing desired functionality compiled and loaded by some initialization command (or empty command ?)
